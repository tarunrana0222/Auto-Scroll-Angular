            <p>Accolade, Inc. was an American game developer and publisher based in San Jose, California. The company was founded in 1984 by Alan Miller and Bob Whitehead, who had previously co-founded Activision. Accolade became known for its sports franchises, including HardBall!, Jack Nicklaus, and Test Drive. By the 1990s, Accolade saw critical acclaim for Star Control, as well as strong sales for Bubsy. However, Sega sued Accolade for creating unauthorized Sega Genesis games by reverse-engineering the console. Accolade won the case on appeal, overturning an injunction that had interrupted their sales. The founders soon left the company and a new chief executive, Peter Harris, attracted new investment. He was replaced by Accolade president Jim Barrett, who focused on existing franchises to secure the company's future, which led to a mix of modest successes and commercial disappointments. In 1999, Accolade was purchased by Infogrames, who absorbed them into their operations soon after. (Full article...)</p>

            <p>Abdulrazak Gurnah was born on 20 December 1948[5] in the Sultanate of Zanzibar, which is now part of present day Tanzania.[6] After fleeing Zanzibar at age 18 to escape persecution of Arab citizens during the Zanzibar Revolution, [7][8] he arrived in England in 1968 as a refugee. Gurnah has been quoted saying, 'I came to England when these words, such as asylum-seeker, were not quite the same - more people are struggling and running from terror states.'[9] [10]

                He initially studied at Christ Church College, Canterbury, whose degrees were at the time awarded by the University of London.[11] He then moved to the University of Kent, where he earned his PhD, with a thesis titled Criteria in the Criticism of West African Fiction,[12] in 1982.[6] From 1980 to 1983, Gurnah lectured at Bayero University Kano in Nigeria. He was a professor at the University of Kent's department of English until his retirement.[7]
                
                Gurnah edited two volumes of Essays on African Writing and has published articles on a number of contemporary postcolonial writers, including V. S. Naipaul, Salman Rushdie and ZoÃ« Wicomb. He is the editor of A Companion to Salman Rushdie (Cambridge University Press, 2007). He has been a contributing editor of Wasafiri since 1987.[13] He has been a judge for awards including the Caine Prize for African Writing[14] and the Booker Prize.[15]
                
                Gurnah lives in the United Kingdom.</p>

            <p>The reverse of the seal was adopted in 1961 and has a more detailed design, which is similar to other coats of arms found in Latin America; The original 1961 act of legislature which established it was unusual in that the act didn't actually define the reverse seal and was simply a picture of the design; it wasn't until 1991 that the seal was actually defined in writing by law as follows:

                [T]he design for the reverse side of the Great Seal of Texas shall consist of a shield, the lower half of which is divided into two parts; on the shield's lower left is a depiction of the cannon of the Battle of Gonzales; on the shield's lower right is a depiction of Vince's Bridge; on the upper half of the shield is a depiction of the Alamo; the shield is circled by live oak and olive branches, and the unfurled flags of the Kingdom of France, the Kingdom of Spain, the United Mexican States, the Republic of Texas, the Confederate States of America, and the United States of America; above the shield is emblazoned the motto, "REMEMBER THE ALAMO", and beneath the shield are the words, "TEXAS ONE AND INDIVISIBLE"; over the entire shield, centered between the flags, is a white five-pointed star.[1]
                
                The flags on the seal are the "six flags over Texas", of the six nations that have had sovereignty over some or all of the current territory of Texas. The original seal pictured in the 1961 act represented the C.S.A. with an Army of Tennessee Confederate battle flag; the 1991 law replaced this with the first C.S.A. flag, known as the "Stars and Bars".[5]
